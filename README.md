# PetUs-Bootstrap
Simple Web Startup using the Boostrap framework

Idea came from "The Web Developer Bootcamp" course from Udemy.com
Only modified to a different startup company with similar structure.

You can run it using this link: https://cdn.rawgit.com/Gerfier/PetUs-Bootstrap/dcde6a10/index.html

To Fix:
-Issue when opening in Firefox and Microsoft Edge, Opera and Chrome displays correctly
    The index file appears blank with only the navbar links and within seconds it displays the page correctly
